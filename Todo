   Using Spring Boot Actuator for health checks, metrics, and application insights.

7. Scheduling:

   Task scheduling with @Scheduled.
   Running periodic tasks or cron jobs.

8. Testing:

   Unit and integration testing with JUnit and Mockito.
   Testing REST endpoints using MockMvc.


9. API Documentation:

   Auto-generating API documentation with tools like Swagger/OpenAPI.
